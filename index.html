    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Akshaya Natarajan, and I am a Computer Science and Engineering student who loves exploring 
      how technology can shape the future. I’ve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity 
      has grown into a passion for solving problems and creating new ideas with code and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a woman in STEM means a lot to me. It hasn’t always been easy stepping into spaces where I don’t 
      always see people who look like me, but that only pushes me to work harder. I want to show that anyone, 
      no matter their background, can dream big and achieve in tech. I believe in standing out, not by being 
      the loudest in the room, but by showing strength through persistence, creativity, and heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey is just beginning, but I know who I am: someone who wants to make a difference, break 
      boundaries, and inspire others by being true to myself. Technology is my tool, but passion and 
      determination are what guide me forward.
